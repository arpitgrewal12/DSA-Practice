Problem: Encode and Decode Strings
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string,
and decode it back to the original list.

-----------------------------------------------------------
üîç Logic:
- For encoding, use a length-prefixed format: <length>#<string>
  - This makes it safe even if the string contains special characters like '#'.
  - Example: ["neet", "code", "you"] ‚Üí "4#neet4#code3#you"

- For decoding:
  - Read characters until you find a '#'
  - The substring before '#' is the length of the word
  - Extract the next `length` characters as the actual word
  - Move forward and repeat

-----------------------------------------------------------
Time complexity: 
O(m)
O(m) for each encode() and decode() function calls.

Reasoning:  
- The encode function loops over the list of strings (m strings) and processes each string.
- The decode function loops over the encoded string, parsing each encoded segment once.
- Since each string is handled once, the complexity is proportional to the number of strings m.

Space complexity: 
O(m + n)
O(m + n) for each encode() and decode() function calls.

Reasoning:
- The space to store the encoded string or the decoded list includes:
  - m: number of strings in the list (metadata like lengths, and list overhead)
  - n: total length of all characters across all strings
- Thus, total space grows linearly with both the number of strings and their total size.
