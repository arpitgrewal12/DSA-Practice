Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can replace at most `k` characters 
in the string so that all characters in the window are the same.
Return the length of the longest such valid substring.

# ðŸ“˜ Approach: Sliding Window with Inner Shrink (No maxFreq variable)
# - Maintain a frequency map of characters inside the current window.
# - Keep expanding the right side.
# - Shrink the window from the left if more than k replacements are needed.
#
# Key condition:
#     (window size) - (most frequent character count) > k
#   If this is True, we shrink from the left.
#
# Time: O(26 * n) â†’ O(n), since max 26 characters
# Space: O(1) â†’ only 26 letters stored in map

# ðŸ“˜ Approach: Sliding Window + Hash Map with maxFreq variable
# Goal: Maximize the window size such that we can make all characters equal
#       by replacing at most `k` other characters in the window.
# 
# Use a sliding window [l, r]. At each step:
# - Count the frequency of the most frequent character in the window.
# - If the rest of the characters exceed `k`, shrink from the left.
#
# Key Condition:
# - (window size - count of max frequent char) â‰¤ k  â†’ valid window
#
# Time: O(n), where n = len(s)
# Space: O(26) = O(1) â†’ because only uppercase English letters

# ðŸ“˜ Sliding Window + Frequency Hash Map with defaultdict
# Maintain a window [l, r] and track the count of characters.
# A window is valid if: (window size - max frequency) <= k
#
# We expand the window by moving `r`, and shrink it from `l`
# if we need more than `k` changes to make all characters equal.
#
# Time: O(n), where n = len(s)
#   - Each character is processed at most twice (expand + shrink)
# Space: O(1)
