Problem: Subtree of Another Tree  
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return True if there is a subtree of root with the 
same structure and node values as subRoot, and False otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree is a tree that consists of a node in the tree and all of this node's descendants.
The tree itself can be considered a subtree of itself.

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# ðŸ“˜ Approach: Recursive DFS with helper function sameTree()
# 1. Check if current nodes' trees are identical (sameTree).
# 2. If not, recurse on left and right subtrees of root.
# Time: O(n*m) worst case, where n = nodes in root, m = nodes in subRoot
# Space: O(m+n) recursion stack
